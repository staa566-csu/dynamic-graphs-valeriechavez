I wish to explore secondary student responses to the questions: 
- Overall, how do you feel about your life? 
- How happy have you been feeling this week?

And compare difference across race/ethnicity and gender
Responses were on a 5 point likert scale, which consisted of 5 emojis ranging from very sad to very happy for the first question. And responses for the second question ranged from never happy (1) to happy all the time (5).


**Data is provided by and property of Youth Truth Student Survey, a national nonprofit, and may only be shared in aggregate for the confidentiality of students and clients.**

Our sample consisted of 161,340 secondary students (Grades 6-12) in the 2021-22 school year across 19 states, and 442 schools.(Note: not all students reponded to every question, so the sample is closer to 130,000).

For the confidentiallity of clients and students, I can't share the original data. 

Schools that choose to work with Youth Truth, and opt in to the Emotional and Mental health additional topic administered the questions to students.
